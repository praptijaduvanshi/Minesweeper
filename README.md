# Minesweeper
The goal of this project was to develop a Minesweeper game using Python and object-oriented programming principles, with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. The project aimed to provide an enjoyable and interactive gaming experience while showcasing proficiency in OOP concepts and GUI development.

The project involved designing and implementing the game logic using classes and methods to handle various game functionalities. Tkinter was used to create the GUI, including the game board, buttons, and other graphical elements. The ctypes library was utilized for displaying pop-up notifications to the user.

Some key features of the Minesweeper game project include a fully functional game board with customizable grid size and mine density, the ability to reveal cells by left-clicking and flag cells by right-clicking, an intuitive user interface with clear visual feedback, and the implementation of game rules to handle player moves and determine game outcomes. Additionally, the integration of pop-up notifications using ctypes enhances the user experience by providing informative alerts and notifications during gameplay.
